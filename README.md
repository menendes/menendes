### Hi there I am Ibrahim HalilðŸ‘‹
#### I improve myself in distributed system architectures, cloud technologies, software life cycles, big data processing and devops as career goals ðŸ”­. In my spare time, I like to follow up-to-date technologies, to read blog posts about them and to follow best practices related to these issues. In addition, I am writing blog posts about the topics I see lacking resources on Medium. I enjoy translating short story books from English to Turkish, watching documentaries and collecting antique items are among my hobbies ðŸŒ±.
