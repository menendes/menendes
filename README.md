### Hi there I am Ibrahim HalilðŸ‘‹
#### I graduated from Cukurova University, Faculty of Engineering, Computer Engineering in 2019. I have completed both of my internships at Etiya Information Technologies. During my internships, I have worked at department of middleware and back-end systems. I continued my career in Etiya Information Technologies and worked in the same departments as a software developer. I want to specialize in distributed system architectures, cloud technologies, software life cycles and design patterns as career goals. Also simulation and game systems attract my attention. You can find various example about these topics. In my spare time, I like to follow up-to-date technologies, to read blog posts about them and to follow practices related to these issues. In addition, I am planning to start writing blog posts about the topics I see lacking Turkish resources. Finally, I enjoy solving various problems and practicing on different topics via HackerRank.
